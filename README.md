## Based on

This model is strongly based on PandaPower, PYPOWER, Networkx, Pandas, Numpy and Xlrd packages. See "*requirements.py*" for version detail.

## How to run

Within source code, the python script "*script_SMCFPL_run.py*" is an example on how import and use SMCFPL package. This script is based on the "*InpuData*" folder, where the should be a *.xlsx* file with system information.
