# SMCFPL model

SMCFPL stands for "Simulaciones de Montecarlo con Flujo de Potencia Linealizado" and pretends to act as a generator of possible scenarios of generation, demand and hydrology for a specific Electric Power System.

## Based on

This model is strongly based on PandaPower (1.6.0), PYPOWER (5.1.4), Networkx (2.2), Pandas (0.23.4) and xlrd (1.2.0) packages.

**Disclaimer:** SMCFPL package is mainly tested under python 3.6.

## How to run

In the source code, there is a directory called "*EntradaDePrueba*" which has two files, one *.xlsx* and a python script. The "*.xlsx*" file contains the IEEE 39bus Power System formated as SMCFPL model's requires. The python script "*script_SMCFPL_run.py*" is and example on how import and use SMCFPL package. This script was the one used to test the model.
